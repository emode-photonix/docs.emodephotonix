
File management
---------------

Simulation data are stored in an EMode Photonix file with the extension '.eph'. This file is created when a simulation is initialized, and existing simulation files can be opened by EMode for further analysis.

.. data:: init
    
    Create a simulation instance with an associated '.eph' file to run the simulation and store data. This function is automatically called when the emodeconnection class is initialized.
    
    :param str save_path: path to save the simulation file relative to the current working directory, default: '.'
    :param str simulation_name: simulation name, default: 'emode'

.. data:: open
    
    Open an existing simulation '.eph' or '.mat' file. This can be used to retrieve previous simulation data or to run a simulation based on a template.
    
    :param str save_path: path to open the simulation file relative to the current working directory, default: '.'
    :param str simulation_name: simulation name, default: 'emode'
    :param str new_name: new simulation name so the old file is not over-written, default: ``simulation_name``

.. data:: get
    
    Extract data from an existing simulation to your Python or MATLAB environment.
    
    :param str key: name of the variable or parameter to extract. This can also be a list of fields of any combination of [``Ex``, ``Ey``, ``Ez``, ``Hx``, ``Hy``, ``Hz``, ``Sx``, ``Sy``, ``Sz``]. See :doc:`Variable Descriptions </emodeguide/variables>` for a complete list and description of all available variables.
    :param str label: name of labeled dataset to extract the data defined by ``key``, default: ''
    :param str simulation_name: simulation name, default: 'emode'

.. data:: clear_field_data
    
    Deletes the following data to reduce the '.eph' file size: ``Fx``, ``Fy``, ``Ex``, ``Ey``, ``Ez``, ``Hx``, ``Hy``, ``Hz``, ``Sx``, ``Sy``, ``Sz``, ``x``, ``y``, ``permittivity``, ``permeability``.
    
    :param str simulation_name: simulation name, default: 'emode'

.. data:: save
    
    Saves a simulation file and keeps the simulation file in the 'open' state. The file can be saved as an EMode Photonix file ('eph') or as a MATLAB-style file ('.mat').
    
    :param bool save_all_fields: whether all field data should be saved (so the ``E``, ``H``, and ``S`` fields can be accessed without an EMode license) or just the raw field data (``Fx`` and ``Fy``), default: False
    :param str file_type: file type to save simulation file ('eph' or 'mat'), default: 'eph'
    :param str new_save_path: if set, saves the simulation file in this new path, default: None
    :param str simulation_name: simulation name, default: 'emode'

.. data:: close
    
    Saves or deletes a simulation file. The file can be saved as an EMode Photonix file ('eph') or as a MATLAB-style file ('.mat'). This function is called through the "close" method of emodeconnection, and these optional parameters can be passed directly to the "close" method.
    
    :param bool save: saves simulation file if True and deletes the simulation file if False, default: True
    :param bool save_all_fields: whether all field data should be saved (so the ``E``, ``H``, and ``S`` fields can be accessed without an EMode license) or just the raw field data (``Fx`` and ``Fy``), default: False
    :param str file_type: file type to save simulation file ('eph' or 'mat'), default: 'eph' for Python connections and 'mat' for MATLAB connections
    :param str simulation_name: simulation name, default: 'emode'
