
Installation
============

Use this page to set up EMode and run a simple example.

1. Get an EMode License
-----------------------

- First, `create an EMode account <https://emodephotonix.com/register/>`_.
- Verify your account via the confirmation email.
- Then, purchase a software license online through the `EMode store <https://emodephotonix.com/get-emode/>`_. This is required, even for a free EMode\ :sup:`2D`\  license.

2. Download and Install EMode
-----------------------------

**System requirements**: 600 MB free disk space

    * **Windows** 10 or higher
    * **Linux**, Ubuntu 22.04 or higher, x86-64 **(Beta)**
    * **macOS** 13 Ventura or higher **(Beta)**

To install EMode, follow these steps:

#.  Login to your `EMode account <https://emodephotonix.com/my-account/>`_.
#.  On your account page, select an operating system (Windows, Linux, or macOS) from the dropdown menu.
#.  Click the ``Download EMode`` button to download the appropriate file for your selected operating system (an installer for Windows, an executable for Linux & macOS).

    * **For Windows Users**: Run the downloaded installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
    * **For Linux and macOS Users**: The downloaded file is an executable, not an installer. You will need to move it to a directory included in your system's `PATH`. Here is an example command to run from a terminal window.

      .. code-block:: bash

        sudo mv ~/Downloads/EMode /usr/local/bin/

      .. warning::
        The Linux and macOS versions of EMode are currently in beta. Please `report <https://emodephotonix.com/contact/>`_ any problems you find.

      .. tip::
        On macOS with an ARM processor (Apple Silicon), the first time you run EMode, you may see a prompt asking you to install **Rosetta 2**. Please proceed with this installation as it is required to run EMode on Apple Silicon. This is not necessary for Intel-based macOS machines.

3. Setup a Scripting Interface
------------------------------

.. grid:: 2
    :gutter: 4
    :padding: 0
    :margin: auto

    .. grid-item-card:: :ref:`Python setup <SetupPython>`

    .. grid-item-card:: :ref:`MATLAB setup <SetupMATLAB>`


4. Run an EMode Example Script
------------------------------

- Copy and run the `Basic: SOI <examples/SOI.html>`_ example in your scripting environment.
- An account login window will open when EMode is first initialized. To subsequently access this window, run ``EMode`` from the command line.
