EME: GDS
--------

To simulate more complex structures, a GDS import function is used to support any geometry that can be created on a mask GDS file. This example shows how an s-bend structure can be created in a GDS file, imported to EMode, and simulated as part of a directional coupler.

First, the GDS is created.

        ## Parameters
        width_wg = 0.6 # [um]
        gap_input = 2.0 # [um]
        gap_output = 0.3 # [um]
        L_bend = 6.0 # [um]

        ## Create the first CrossSection
        X1 = CrossSection()
        X1.add(width = width_wg,
            offset = -gap_input/2 - width_wg/2, layer = 1,
            name = 'wg1', ports = ('in1', 'out1'))

        X1.add(width = width_wg,
            offset = gap_input/2 + width_wg/2, layer = 1,
            name = 'wg2')

        ## Create the second CrossSection
        X2 = CrossSection()
        X2.add(width = width_wg,
            offset = -gap_output/2 - width_wg/2, layer = 1,
            name = 'wg1', ports = ('in2', 'out2'))

        X2.add(width = width_wg,
            offset = gap_output/2 + width_wg/2, layer = 1,
            name = 'wg2')

        ## Transition from first to second CrossSection
        Xtrans = pp.transition(cross_section1 = X1, cross_section2 = X2, width_type = 'sine')
        P3 = pp.straight(length = L_bend)
        WG_trans = P3.extrude(Xtrans)

        ## Place all CrossSection extrusions
        D = Device()
        wgt = D << WG_trans

        ## Quickplot to view
        qp(D)

        ## Save gds file
        D.write_gds('sbend.gds')

Next, the directional coupler device is created and simulated for a short coupler length. The sweep function is used to optimize  the coupler length for 100 % coupling, and the propagation is re-plotted.
